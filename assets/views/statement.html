			My work is about engaging with the colors and textures of the natural environment in order to draw attention to its mysteries and heal our spirits.
      It draws from a tradition of art-making inspired by gratitude for the natural environment. I use simple materials and methods to explore and express what I feel and think in each moment.
      It is a way of listening to and responding to my surroundings and learning from what I experience in my interactions with people and nature.
