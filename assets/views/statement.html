		<p>I organize my thoughts and feelings through the art-making process.
			I am interested in reviving the experience of childhood through my process, recreating feelings of freedom
			and giving myself permission to dream. My point of departure is my personal history and inner monologue,
			and all of the emotions that come with these memories and thoughts.
			My work is about the pull of my inner child at the same time as it is about my adult experience of existing
			in a competitive, dynamic world.</p>
		<p>My paintings express a fantasy in which we are free to be chaotic and impulsive without consequence.
			They are a visual combination of structure that is predictable and creates an illusion of security,
			and natural and animal forces that are chaotic, unpredictable, surprising, and tempting.</p>
		<p><i>Identity Spheres</i> is a visual collection of thoughts that occupy my mind at this moment in my life,
			as well as representations of cultural knowledge that I draw upon as I make decisions in my daily life.
			This body of work emerges from a place of inner conflict about cultural identity
			and documents the feeling of being pulled by opposing cultural forces.
			At the same time, it represents the fulfillment of a place where seemingly conflicting sets of cultural knowledge
			come together harmoniously.</p>
