			My work is about capturing gratitude and wonder for nature and augmenting the viewerâ€™s experience of the natural environment.
			I see my images as contributing to a collective and historical body of work that depicts and directs attention to nature at a time of rapid technological progress.
			I draw inspiration from the natural world and create my images with spontaneous wonder for my subjects and scenes.
			My work asks the viewer to notice and appreciate natural subjects while viewing them through a modern, human-made lens.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my artistic method I seek to preserve and document in order to more fully relive and contemplate our relationship with nature.
			My creative process and color palette are contemporary and at times experimental.
			The subjects in my images are brighter in color than they present in reality.
			I take comfort in the freedom to paint spontaneously and intuitively while preserving the intensity of the colors and spirit of my medium and subjects.
